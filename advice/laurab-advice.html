                <h4>You think you have specific disadvantages, but you probably don't</h4>
                <p>Yes, this is very new for you, yes, you might not have been that engaged in computers or maths, or technology, etc. Maybe you are older, like me, and still want to learn new things. Remember that you are learning a new skill that nobody is born with, that you can really learn! There are lots of great examples of people who did it before, you can do it, too.</p>
 
                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
 
                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
 
                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
